        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Idan, a software engineer based in the Philippines. I am committed to what I do and enjoy the process of engineering ideas into mobile, and website apps.</p>
        <br /><br />
        <p>I like to discover ideas, design, and develop them into applications that people can use. I develop static websites, mobile apps, and full stack applications.</p>
